# ristilaatija, a maker for Finnish cryptic crosswords

This is a fork of [Phil](https://github.com/keiranking/Phil) by Keiran King. It is adapted for cryptic crosswords in Finnish (piilosana), some of which [I've made and published](https://hannuhartikainen.fi/piilosanat/).

## Contributing

I probably will not fix issues filed by other people. There are known bugs and I have my own feature wishlist waiting for when I have motivation.

Pull requests for useful features may be accepted, but it might be a better idea to send them upstream to the Phil repo.

I'm grateful for contributions, but I just do not wish to spend much time on this project.
